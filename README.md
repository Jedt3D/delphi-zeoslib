# delphi-zeoslib

This repository just for testing how far I can use an opensource ZeosLib database connection with Embarcadero's Delphi Starter Edition together. Since the Starter Edition doesn't come with database connection at all. This could be a good choice for people, student who want to learn/teach Delphi along with database oriented topics.
